Going through Ray-tracing in one weekend, and making tweaks here and there.

IDEAS:
- implement multithreading with std::threads, allowing user to see each thread running simultaneously
- reduce inheritance in project to prefer composition (maybe take a "data oriented design" approach)
- make small optimizations based on other approaches to the project (e.g. use less shared pointers and virtual functions)
- add bound volume heirarchy
- add Doxygen-style comments/documentation
- containerize project with Docker

The goal of this project is to become a backend of a web application that uses a web-gl framework to let users design a scene, then call the raytracer, hosted on a custom web server

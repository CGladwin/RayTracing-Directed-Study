- note: I try to adopt a philosophy similar to what I understand rust uses via structs, impls, and traits
- the base vec3 class is analogous to a struct, where the only behaviour defined is to make the class' objects interact in the way np.ndarrays interact (essentially giving us a base data type)
- point3 adds functionality specific for position points

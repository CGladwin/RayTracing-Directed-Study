### Goals
This will serve as a blog of my struggles, and documentation for the decisions made in the code-base. It might be a useful reference if you're going through Shirley's Raytracing in one Weekend and don't have a strong c++ background like I did, or you forgot most math you've learned in your life like I did. It also might help with learning how C++ interacts with javascript in the backend.

I'm just one undergrad student, so expect spellling errors and some stuff to be confusing, unfinished, and poorly explained.  I want to use a semi-playful conversational tone, inspired by "Learn you a haskell for great good", which strikes a great balance between informative and fun to read.

### My departures from the code
My first major change is what I'm implementing in the second book. I'm skipping half of it for time, and only adding:
  - Bound Volume Hierarchy
  - Lighting
  - Quads
  - Instances (Probably)
I expect this will require me to refactor the code a bit.

### Iterating on the project

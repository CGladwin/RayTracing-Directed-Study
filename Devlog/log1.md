### Goals
This will serve as a blog of my struggles. It might be a useful reference if you're going through Shirley's Raytracing in one Weekend and don't have a strong c++ background. It also might help with learning how c++ interacts with javascript in the backend.

I'm just one undergrad student, so expect spelling errors and some stuff to be confusing. I want to use a semi-playful conversational tone, inspired by "Learn you a haskell for great good", which strikes a great balance between informative and fun (or about as fun as programming gets) to read.

### Math Pre-Requisite Knowledge
- vectors
  - think of a vector like an arrow in space. 
  - It has magnitude (length)
  - It has direction
- scalars
  - a scalar is a value whose only attribute is its magnitude
  - notably, a scalar can only be 1 number
- 
- a ray here is a function P(t)=A+tb
  - the Position "P" for a given time "t" is equal to the ray origin "A" plus the t mult'd by its direction "b"
